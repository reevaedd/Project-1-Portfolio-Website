# Project-1-Portfolio-Website
This project is about creating a portfolio website.
The main feature of this project 1 is the use of boostrap grid system.
The grid layout allows to easily divide the large area of a website page into small ones and then place easily objects in each small area. In addition, it is also a good tool for Responsive Web Design.
